# Summary

``PyUnfold`` is an extensible framework for iterative unfolding via the method described in 
[@agostini] with implementation of the unfolding uncertainty contributions outlined in [@adye2].
Full derivations of the statistical and systematic uncertainty propagation can be found in the 
LaTeX documentation.

The primary purpose of ``PyUnfold`` is to provide a framework for iterative unfolding
beyond the high-energy physics community.
This is accomplished by only requiring input information as numpy arrays.
