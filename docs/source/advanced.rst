There are several advanced unfolding techniques that PyUnfold supports. Most notably these include:

    :maxdepth: 1

    Implementing a user-defined prior <user_prior.ipynb>
    Smoothing via spline regularization <regularization.ipynb>

The above links lead to example notebooks that walk through each of these techniques.
