    :maxdepth: 1

    Implementing a user-defined prior <notebooks/user_prior.ipynb>
    Smoothing via spline regularization <notebooks/regularization.ipynb>
    Multivariate unfolding via cause groups <notebooks/multivariate.ipynb>


The above links lead to example notebooks that walk through each of these techniques.

These example notebooks can also be launched on a live notebook server using `Binder <https://mybinder.org/>`_. To launch a notebook server click the badge below
