There are several advanced unfolding techniques that PyUnfold supports. Most notably these include:

    :maxdepth: 1

    Implementing a user-defined prior <notebooks/user_prior.ipynb>
    Smoothing via spline regularization <notebooks/regularization.ipynb>
    Multivariate unfolding via cause groups <notebooks/multivariate.ipynb>


The above links lead to example notebooks that walk through each of these techniques. These example notebooks can also be run using `Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jrbourbeau/pyunfold/advanced_usage_tutorial?filepath=docs%2Fsource%2Fnotebooks>`_.
