**PyUnfold is a Python package for implementing iterative unfolding** [1]_

PyUnfold provides an unfolding toolkit for members of all scientific disciplines with a simple, user-friendly API. Implementing an unfolding with PyUnfold only takes a few lines of code.

.. code-block:: python

    from pyunfold import iterative_unfold

    # Observed distributions
    data = [100, 150]
    data_err = [10, 12.2]

    # Response matrix
    response = [[0.9, 0.1],
                [0.1, 0.9]]
    response_err = [[0.01, 0.01],
                    [0.01, 0.01]]

    # Detection efficiencies
    efficiencies = [1, 1]
    efficiencies_err = [0.01, 0.01]

    # Perform iterative unfolding
    unfolded_result = iterative_unfold(data=data,
                                       data_err=data_err,
                                       response=response,
                                       response_err=response_err,
                                       efficiencies=efficiencies,
                                       efficiencies_err=efficiencies_err)
